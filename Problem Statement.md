# Dataset: Sleep Productivity
## 3. Theme: "The Mood Meter": Sleep Your Way to Happiness
- ### Scenario: Feeling grumpy? Your team of mood maestros will analyze the data to understand the link between sleep, mood, and stress.
- ### Challenge: Develop a "Mood Meter" dashboard. Use correlation analysis and sentiment analysis (if you could incorporate text data) to explore the relationships between sleep quality, mood score, and stress level. Visualize these relationships with interactive charts. Implement a "Mood Booster" feature that suggests personalized strategies for improving mood through better sleep. Bonus points for adding a "Stress Buster" game that uses biofeedback (if you could add heart rate data) to help users relax and improve sleep. Data Analysis/Preprocessing: Sentiment analysis (if applicable), correlation analysis, data visualization, data filtering.
